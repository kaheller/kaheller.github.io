    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="new-font" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 0,5; padding-left: 1;"> Hi! I am Katha! <br> I am a passionate Design Student, currently living in Potsdam, Germany. 
    <br> I like to think that I can draw pretty well, so why not make a career out of it? I am especially interested in game interface design, illustration and web animation. You can take a look at some of my favourite works, as well as commission me for work or just have a nice chat :D <br> 
or you can check out what socials I might use in the future. You can find me pretty much anywhere :] <br> I hope I can bring some delight to you in some way!</p>
